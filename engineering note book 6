this week me and my partner worked in cad to try and build the tebuchet although we agreed that instead of creating the complex build, we sould just build the arduino part.
The problums this week were trying to make the trebuchet in cad and figure out how to make are code true the servo. We fixed the first problum by not doing it and focusing on other things, 
the second problum is still to be fixxed although i think it should be more up to my partner as it is code and i am doing all of the fisical stuff.
